# Code Auditing Tool

This is a simple Python-based tool to audit Python and JavaScript code for common security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, weak hashing algorithms, and hardcoded passwords.

## Features
- Detects common vulnerabilities using pattern matching.
- Scans Python (`.py`) and JavaScript (`.js`) files for security risks.
- Displays potential vulnerabilities, their descriptions, and suggested fixes.

## How It Works
The tool scans your codebase for vulnerabilities based on patterns defined in the `vulnerabilities.json` file. Each pattern corresponds to a specific security issue, such as SQL Injection or XSS.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-auditing-tool.git
    ```

2. Add your project files to the directory or point the script to the correct folder.

3. Run the tool:
    ```bash
    python auditor.py
    ```

4. The tool will scan Python and JavaScript files for potential vulnerabilities and print the results to the console.

## Adding New Vulnerabilities
To add new vulnerability patterns, edit the `vulnerabilities.json` file and include new entries with the following structure:
```json
{
    "Vulnerability Name": {
        "pattern": "regex_pattern",
        "description": "Brief description of the vulnerability",
        "solution": "Suggested solution"
    }
}
```

Disclaimer
This tool is for educational purposes only. It may not detect all vulnerabilities and should be used in conjunction with more advanced static analysis tools.

#### `.gitignore`
This file is used to exclude unnecessary files from the repository.

```txt
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
```

How It Works
Pattern Matching: The script uses regular expressions to search for vulnerable patterns in Python and JavaScript files.
Vulnerability Definitions: Vulnerabilities are defined in the vulnerabilities.json file, making it easy to add or modify vulnerability checks.
Output: For each vulnerability found, the script prints the file name, line number, a description of the vulnerability, and a suggested fix.

Installation & Running
Add Your Codebase: Place your code files (Python or JavaScript) in the directory or specify the folder to scan.
Run the Script: Use python auditor.py to scan your project.

Extensibility
You can easily extend the tool by adding more vulnerabilities to the vulnerabilities.json file. You can also integrate it with Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines to automate code audits.
